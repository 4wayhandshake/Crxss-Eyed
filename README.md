# Crxss-Eyed
Performs semi-automated Blind XSS based on HTML form submission

The script uses a variety of payloads and context escapes. Labels each payload with: 
    - its name, 
    - what escape was used,
    - what field it was inserted into.

Works best with https://github.com/4wayhandshake/simple-http-server
